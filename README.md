# Smart-Cam-Bot
This Repo contains source files for SmartCamBot, a project created by a DPRG team for the 2016 Nov 18 AT&T Hackathon and the 2017 Jan 3/4 Invitational Hackathon.

There are two sections
- Arduino Code => contains sketches for the Arduino based RoMeo BLE board which powers the robot base
- SmartCamBot App => contains UWP (Universal Windows Program) source code which provides drive commands to the robot base, as well as interfaces to camera, IBM Watson, Twitter and TWilio
